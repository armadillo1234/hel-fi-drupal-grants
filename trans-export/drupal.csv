,Drupal's core capabilities,,,,,,,
,Drupal provides many of the features you need to start building powerful websites right out-of-the-box. The features presented in this demo are based entirely on Drupal 8's core functionality.,,,,,,,
,"This is the main navigation menu for the Umami website. It is simple to create and administer menus and you can create as many menus as your site requires. For example, this site provides this main navigation as well as the user navigation displayed above.",,,,,,,
,The Umami theme,,,,,,,
,This website uses the custom Umami theme to style its appearance. This theme has been created using CSS and by customizing Drupal's HTML templates that are built using the popular Twig templating system. Themes are also available for download and installation.,,,,,,,
,Managing content,,,,,,,
,This example website provides a collection of articles and recipes that demonstrate how content can easily be managed in a flexible and structured way.,,,,,,,
,Configuring content display,,,,,,,
,Display modes can be configured to provide different presentations of content. These promoted articles and recipes use the display modes feature to format the images with different ratios.,,,,,,,
,Displaying content with Views,,,,,,,
,"Drupal makes it simple to create lists of filtered content and control how the content is displayed using the Views feature. This latest recipes example uses a view to fetch the most recent four recipes, displays the view as a block that is positioned on the front page with the block system.",,,,,,,
,Continue exploring Drupal,,,,,,,
,The front page tour is now over. Feel free to click around and continue exploring Drupal.,,,,,,,

,"If the <em>Source</em> button is available in the toolbar, users can click this button to disable the visual editor and edit the HTML source directly. After toggling back, the visual editor uses the allowed HTML tags to format the text — independent of whether buttons for these tags are available in the toolbar. If the text format is set to <em>limit the use of HTML tags</em>, then all excluded tags will be stripped out of the HTML source when the user toggles back to the text editor.",,,,,,,
,"If you change the text format on a text field, the text editor will change as well because the text editor configuration is associated with the individual text format. This allows the use of the same text editor with different options for different text formats. It also allows users to choose between text formats with different text editors if they are installed.",,,,,,,

The <em>integer</em> type allows storing whole numbers, such as years (for example, 2012) or values (for example, 1, 2, 5, 305). The <em>text</em> list field type allows storing text values.

,Entities and entity types,,,,,,,
,"The website's content and configuration is managed using <em>entities</em>, which are grouped into <em>entity types</em>. <em>Content entity types</em> are the entity types for site content (such as the main site content, comments, custom blocks, taxonomy terms, and user accounts). <em>Configuration entity types</em> are used to store configuration information for your site, such as individual views in the Views module, and settings for your main site content types.",,,,,,,
,Entity sub-types,,,,,,,
,"Some content entity types are further grouped into sub-types (for example, you could have article and page content types within the main site content entity type, and tag and category vocabularies within the taxonomy term entity type); other entity types, such as user accounts, do not have sub-types. Programmers use the term <em>bundle</em> for entity sub-types.",,,,,,,
,"Content entity types and sub-types store most of their text, file, and other information in <em>fields</em>. Fields are grouped by <em>field type</em>; field types define what type of data can be stored in that field, such as text, images, or taxonomy term references.",,,,,,,
,Formatters and view modes,,,,,,,
,"Content entity types and sub-types can have one or more <em>view modes</em>, used for displaying the entity items. For instance, a content item could be viewed in full content mode on its own page, teaser mode in a list, or RSS mode in a feed. In each view mode, each field can be hidden or displayed, and if it is displayed, you can choose and configure the <em>formatter</em> that is used to display the field. For instance, a long text field can be displayed trimmed or full-length, and taxonomy term reference fields can be displayed in plain text or linked to the taxonomy term page.",,,,,,,
,Widgets and form modes,,,,,,,
,"Content entity types and sub-types can have one or more <em>form modes</em>, used for editing. For instance, a content item could be edited in a compact format with only some fields editable, or a full format that allows all fields to be edited. In each form mode, each field can be hidden or displayed, and if it is displayed, you can choose and configure the <em>widget</em> that is used to edit the field. For instance, a taxonomy term reference field can be edited using a select list, radio buttons, or an autocomplete widget.",,,,,,,
,Views entity field handler,,,,,,,
,Creating a field,,,,,,,
,"On the <em>Manage fields</em> page for your entity type or sub-type, you can add, configure, and delete fields for that entity type or sub-type. Each field has a <em>machine name</em>, which is used internally to identify the field and must be unique across an entity type; once a field is created, you cannot change the machine name. Most fields have two types of settings. The field-level settings depend on the field type, and affect how the data in the field is stored. Once they are set, they can no longer be changed; examples include how many data values are allowed for the field and where files are stored. The sub-type-level settings are specific to each entity sub-type the field is used on, and they can be changed later; examples include the field label, help text, default value, and whether the field is required or not. You can return to these settings by choosing the <em>Edit</em> link for the field from the <em>Manage fields</em> page.",,,,,,,
,Re-using fields,,,,,,,
,"Once you have created a field, you can use it again in other sub-types of the same entity type. For instance, if you create a field for the article content type, you can also use it for the page content type, but you cannot use it for custom blocks or taxonomy terms. If there are fields available for re-use, after clicking <em>Add field</em> from the <em>Manage fields</em> page, you will see a list of available fields for re-use. After selecting a field for re-use, you can configure the sub-type-level settings.",,,,,,,
,Configuring field editing,,,,,,,
,"On the <em>Manage form display</em> page of your entity type or sub-type, you can configure how the field data is edited by default and in each form mode. If your entity type has multiple form modes (on most sites, most entities do not), you can toggle between the form modes at the top of the page, and you can toggle whether each form mode uses the default settings or custom settings in the <em>Custom display settings</em> section. For each field in each form mode, you can select the widget to use for editing; some widgets have additional configuration options, such as the size for a text field, and these can be edited using the Edit button (which looks like a wheel). You can also change the order of the fields on the form. You can exclude a field from a form by choosing <em>Hidden</em> from the widget drop-down list, or by dragging it into the <em>Disabled</em> section.",,,,,,,

,"When you define an image style, you will need to choose a displayed name and a machine name. The displayed name is shown in administrative pages, and the machine name is used to generate the URL for accessing an image processed in that style. There are two common approaches to naming image styles: either based on the effects being applied (for example, <em>Square 85x85</em>), or based on where you plan to use it (for example, <em>Profile picture</em>).",,,,,,,
,Configuring image fields,,,,,,,
,"A few of the settings for image fields are defined once when you create the field and cannot be changed later; these include the choice of public or private file storage and the number of images that can be stored in the field. The rest of the settings can be edited later; these settings include the field label, help text, allowed file extensions, image resolution restrictions, and the subdirectory in the public or private file storage where the images will be stored. The editable settings can also have different values for different entity sub-types; for instance, if your image field is used on both Page and Article content types, you can store the files in a different subdirectory for the two content types.",,,,,,,
,"The maximum file size that can be uploaded is limited by PHP settings of the server, but you can restrict it further by configuring a <em>Maximum upload size</em> in the field settings (this setting can be changed later).

,Working with multilingual views,,,,,,,
,"If your site has multiple languages and translated entities, each result row in a view will contain one translation of each involved entity (a view can involve multiple entities if it uses relationships). You can use a filter to restrict your view to one language: without filtering, if an entity has three translations it will add three rows to the results; if you filter by language, at most one result will appear (it could be zero if that particular entity does not have a translation matching your language filter choice). If a view uses relationships, each entity in the relationship needs to be filtered separately. You can filter a view to a fixed language choice, such as English or Spanish, or to the language selected by the page the view is displayed on (the language that is selected for the page by the language detection settings either for Content or User interface).",,,,,,,
,"Because each result row contains a specific translation of each entity, field-level filters are also relative to these entity translations. For example, if your view has a filter that specifies that the entity title should contain a particular English word, you will presumably filter out all rows containing Chinese translations, since they will not contain the English word.

,"The concept of image styles is that you can upload a single image but display it in several ways; each display variation, or <em>image style</em>, is the result of applying one or more <em>effects</em> to the original image. As an example, you might upload a high-resolution image with a 4:3 aspect ratio, and display it scaled down, square cropped, or black-and-white (or any combination of these effects). The Image module provides a way to do this efficiently: you configure an image style with the desired effects on the <a href="":image"">Image styles page</a>, and the first time a particular image is requested in that style, the effects are applied. The resulting image is saved, and the next time that same style is requested, the saved image is retrieved without the need to recalculate the effects.

,"Once the sizes option is selected, you can let the browser know the size of this image in relation to the site layout, using the <em>Sizes</em> field.

For an image that fills 90% of the screen for small viewports, but only fills 40% of the screen when the viewport is larger than 40em (typically 640px), you could enter ""(min-width: 40em) 40vw, 90vw"" in the Sizes field. The last item in the comma-separated list is the smallest viewport size: other items in the comma-separated list should have a media condition paired with an image width. <em>Media conditions</em> are similar to a media query, often a min-width paired with a viewport width using em or px units: e.g. (min-width: 640px) or (min-width: 40em). This is paired with the <em>image width</em> at that viewport size using px, em or vw units.

,Overview of accessibility,,,,,,,
,"The core administrative interface has built-in compliance with many accessibility standards, so that most pages are accessible to most users in their default state. However, certain pages become more accessible to some users through the use of a non-default interface. These replacement interfaces include:",,,,,,,
,"The default drag-and-drop user interface for ordering tables in the administrative interface presents a challenge for some users, including keyboard-only users and users of screen readers and other assistive technology. The drag-and-drop interface can be disabled in a table by clicking a link labeled <em>Show row weights</em> above the table. The replacement interface allows users to order the table by choosing numerical weights (with increasing numbers) instead of dragging table rows.",,,,,,,
,Administrative interface overview,,,,,,,
,The administrative interface has several components:,,,,,,,
,"Accessibility features, to enable all users to perform administrative tasks.",,,,,,,
,"A menu system, which you can navigate to find pages for administrative tasks. The core Toolbar module displays this menu on the top or left side of the page (right side in right-to-left languages).

A site can have one or more <em>shortcut sets</em>, which can be shared by one or more users (by default, there is only one set shared by all users); each set contains a limited number of shortcuts. Users need <em>Use shortcuts</em> permission to view shortcuts; <em>Edit current shortcut set</em> permission to add, delete, or edit the shortcuts in the set assigned to them; and <em>Select any shortcut set</em> permission to select a different shortcut set when editing their user profile. There is also an <em>Administer shortcuts</em> permission, which allows an administrator to do any of these actions, as well as select shortcut sets for other users.",,,,,,,
,"Make sure that the core Shortcut module is enabled, and that you have a role with <em>Edit current shortcut set</em> or <em>Administer shortcuts</em> permission. Also, make sure that a toolbar module is installed (either the core Toolbar module or a contributed module replacement).",,,,,,,
,Navigate to an administrative page that you want in your shortcut list.,,,,,,,
,"Click the shortcut link to add the page to your shortcut list -- in the core Seven administrative theme, the link looks like a star, and is displayed next to the page title.

,"Set up your site to respond appropriately to site errors, including 403 and 404 page responses.",,,,,,,
,What are 403 and 404 responses?,,,,,,,
,"When a user visits a web page, the web server sends a response code in addition to the page content. A normal, non-error response has code 200. If the page does not exist on the site, the response code is 404. If the page exists, but the user is not authorized to visit the page, the response code is 403. The core software provides default responses for both 403 and 404 codes, but if you prefer, you can create your own pages for each.",,,,,,,
,What other errors can occur?,,,,,,,
,"Under some situations, your site can generate error messages. These can be due to user errors (such as entering invalid values in a form, or incorrect configuration), PHP runtime errors, or software bugs. Some errors may result in a <em>white screen of death</em> (a totally blank web page response); less drastic errors will generate error messages. You can configure what happens when an error message is generated.",,,,,,,
,"If desired, create pages to use for 403 and 404 responses. Note the URLs for these pages.",,,,,,,
,"In the <em>Error pages</em> section, enter the URL for your 403/403 pages, starting after the site home page URL. For example, if your site URL is <em>https://example.com</em> and your 404 page is <em>https://example.com/not-found</em>, you would enter <em>/not-found</em>.",,,,,,,

,Take a tour of an administrative page.,,,,,,,
,What are tours?,,,,,,,
,"The core Tour module provides users with <em>tours</em>, which are guided tours of the administrative interface. Each tour starts on a particular administrative page, and consists of one or more <em>tips</em> that highlight elements of the page, guide you through a workflow, or explain key concepts. Users need <em>Access tour</em> permission to view tours, and JavaScript must be enabled in their browsers.",,,,,,,
,"Make sure that the core Tour module is installed, and that you have a role with the <em>Access tour</em> permission. Also, make sure that a toolbar module is installed (either the core Toolbar module or a contributed module replacement).",,,,,,,

,"You can configure what happens to content that a user created, if their account is <em>canceled</em> (deleted).",,,,,,,
,"You can edit the email messages that are sent to users when their accounts are pending, approved, created, blocked, or canceled, or when they request a password reset.",,,,,,,
,What are variables in email message text?,,,,,,,
,"<em>Variables</em> are short text strings, enclosed in square brackets [], that you can insert into configured email message text. When an individual message is generated, data from your site is substituted for the variables. Some commonly-used variables are:",,,,,,,
,[site:login-url]: The URL where users can log in to your site.,,,,,,,
,[user:display-name]: The user's displayed name.,,,,,,,
,[user:account-name]: The users's account name.,,,,,,,

The regulation underlines that consent must be <strong>unambiguous</strong> and involve a <strong>clear affirmative action</strong>. When evaluating how to best handle the requirements in the GDPR, remember that if you have a basic web site where the visitors don't log in, you always have the option to <strong>not process data that identifies individuals</strong>, in which case you may not need this module. Also note that GDPR applies to any electronic processing or storage of personal data that your organization may do, and simply installing a module may not be enough to become fully GDPR compliant.",,,,,,,
